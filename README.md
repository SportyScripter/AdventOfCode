# Advent of Code Solutions

![Advent of Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Advent%20of%20Code-2023-brightgreen.svg)

Welcome to my repository, where you can find solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges! I take on the challenge of solving daily puzzles using Java and Python. Below is a brief description of how the repository is organized and information on how to use my solutions.

## Repository Structure

- Each day of Advent of Code has its own directory: `Day_01_**`, `Day_02_**`, etc.
- In each directory, you will find source code files in Java or Python corresponding to that day.
- Input files for individual tasks are placed in the respective files (e.g., `***.txt`).

## How to Use the Solutions?

1. Choose the day you are interested in.
2. Read the task in the `README.md` file in that directory to understand what it's about.
3. Go to the source file and check the solution.
4. If you wish, test the code with your own input data.

## Additional Information

- Each solution is written in a clear and commented manner to facilitate understanding.
- As I progress through Advent of Code, I will systematically update the repository.

## About Advent of Code
